                    SPAx is a program that started as SPAA or Student Professional Awareness Programs in 1976. In the over 40 years since, thousands of events have taken place around the world. These activities are organized by IEEE Student Branches and give students a chance to listen to experienced engineers from diverse backgrounds discuss topics from various professional development categories. These activities can involve virtual and in person talks and presentations, panel sessions as well as hands-on team-oriented activities focused on giving practical, real-world engineering experience. Students propose projects through the following portal and are connected to their Regional SPAx Coordinator.

                    The “x” in SPAx is a variable. It could be a conference with an invited speaker, a series of activities focused on honing career skills, a social event to foster networking and team building skills, a design contest, a tech talk, or any other format, as long as they focus on career development. You decide what works for your student branch, and IEEE gives you the support to implement your ideas. You create your own SPAx events, and the experience is yours to design. Here is your tour guide to all things SPAx.

                    Hosting your own event is not only a fantastic experience, it is a fantastic resume booster. Try to get some real world companies to sponsor your event, and bring out some potential hiring recruiters. The possibilities are endless.
