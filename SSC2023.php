The survival of our societies and our shared planet depends on a more sustainable world.Sustainable development is an organizing principle that aims to meet human development goals while also enabling natural systems to provide necessary natural resources and ecosystem services to humans. The desired result is a society where living conditions and resources meet human needs without undermining the planetary integrity and stability of the natural system.Sustainable development tries to find a balance between economic development, environmental protection, and social well-being.             </p>
