                        One of the most elegant societies of IEEE, The Photonics Society was initially named as IEEE Quantum Electronics Council and was found in 1965. Later it was renamed into IEEE Photonics Society in April 2009. 
                        <br><br>
                        Right from the LEDs that brought the colorful sparks in our lives to the lasers and optical fibres that revolutionized the medical and telecommunication era, the Photonics society focuses on spheres associated with light wave technology and their applications in systems and subsystems in which quantum electronic devices are key elements.
                        <br><br>
                        The society is concerned with the research, development, design, manufacture, and applications of materials, devices and systems, and with the various scientific and technological activities which contribute to the useful expansion of the field of quantum electronics and applications.

                        The IEEE Photonics Society believes that equality, diversity and inclusion issues within the field are community issues, as well as culture issues. As such, the IEEE Photonics Society is committed to taking proactive steps to highlight how diversity is essential to innovation. 
                        <br><br>
                        Society seeks to ensure that its decision-makers are diverse. People of different experiences bring new ways of thinking to the table, which sparks creativity. As its first step in achieving a more diverse community, the Society’s Board of Governors created a ‘Diversity Oversight Committee’ to ensure that the global diversity of the community the Society serves is represented in all aspects of the organization and that the Society’s leaders are addressing diversity needs and concerns appropriately.

                        While many Life members remain active in IEEE projects at various levels of IEEE, the Life Members Committee encourages the formation of Life Members Affinity Groups in Sections because the committee believes more Life members will remain involved if there are Life Members Affinity Groups.

                        Life Members Groups enable Life members to retain active IEEE associations, contribute to the social good in their communities, advance the professional interests of IEEE, allow members to enjoy each other's company.

The LMC annually recognizes one Life Member Affinity Group (LMAG) for their activities held for Life members.
                         <br><br>
                         Life Members Affinity Groups are a subunit of the Life Members Committee. They are established upon petition to the MGA Board and with the cooperation of the Section Chair. The Life Members Fund provides annual funding to groups for support of Life member activities through their respective regional life member coordinators.
