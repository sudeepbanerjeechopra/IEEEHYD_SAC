                <p class="text-muted">Student branches are crucial to the growth and development of IEEE Student members. Student branches create a local network of students and give students the opportunity to meet and learn from fellow students, as well as faculty members and professionals in the field.
                <br><br>
                Student branches offer numerous educational, technical, and professional advantages to IEEE Student members through special projects, activities, meetings, tours, and field trips.
                <br><br>
                However, these activities and advantages arenâ€™t done without the effort, labor, and diligence of volunteers. IEEE has created several Student Branch Awards to recognize and reward the efforts of these tireless individuals and teams.
                <br><br>
                All award nominations should be submitted via <a href="https://ieee.secure-platform.com/a/solicitations/457/home"><strong>Student Awards Portal</strong></a>
                <br><br>IEEE Student Awards submissions open on <strong>1st February Each Year</strong> and close on <strong>31st March Each Year</strong></p>
