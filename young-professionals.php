                    As you think about your career post graduation we would like to inform you that there’s a larger IEEE organization outside of the Student program you’ve come to know and hopefully love.
                    <br><br>
                    To help you understand what’s still available to you and how you can continue to network – contribute – grow – we recommend working with your student branch to connect with a local Young Professionals Affinity Group.
                    <br><br>
                    These Affinity groups plan events from lectures to interactive workshop and networking events all over the world – and there is likely one near you! If not, and you’re so inclined we can help you start one.
